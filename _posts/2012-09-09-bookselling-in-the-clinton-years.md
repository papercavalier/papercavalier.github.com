I remember the first Barnes and Nobel I visited. The year was 1993 and I was in Chicago attending a program at Northwestern University. The BN was downtown and it was unlike anything I’d every seen before. Floor after floor of books, organized by every subject imaginable. The periodical section alone seemed larger than the little bookstore I’d shop in back in San Antonio. Magazines and newspapers from around the world, with the papers restocked daily. It was amazing.

Within another year Barnes and Nobel came to San Antonio. Though not on the same scale as the big downtown Chicago store, it nonetheless brought titles that had probably never before been offered in that sleepy south Texas city. Soon a Borders came too and established a reputation for an even deeper dip into the back catalog; small press and university press titles, right there on the shelf for the browser to discover.

These stores, in their moment, seemed to represent the best of the 1990’s. Information was spreading fast, available in places it had never been before. There was an optimism to this capitalism, and optimism that an enormous bookstore, dropped into a mall, a downtown area, an urban renewal project or even as the very anchor of a big box shopping center could sell books to everyone.

Before this era, bookstores were small affairs, often specialized and inward looking places. Or they were the property of universities, serving an institution first, the public second. These stores came with a new perspective; bookstores were not quaint nooks and crannies in the retail landscape, bookstores could be anchors, top bill destinations for the masses of people who might not otherwise even think of spending an afternoon browsing books.

But of course these big box stores were also the worst of the 90s in America. For all their depth, they were also generic, tasteless and corporate in tone. Through a massive supply chain, exclusive deals with publishers and the ability to price bestsellers and loss leaders, BN and Borders drove smaller independent stores out of business just as the official BN cafe, Starbucks, was eliminating local coffee shops.

Those smaller affairs, the indie stores, often had long standing ties with cities and neighborhoods; the chains were just chains, corporate enterprises answering to stockholders far away from the communities. And these faceless stockholders might have exactly the same interest in BN as they would for the Bed Bath and Beyond next door or the Starbucks inside. With attractive locations in abandoned sheds such as Baltimore’s “Power Plant,” or San Antonio’s decommissioned ”Quarry” BN was a post industrial creation, books sold and consumed in the style of the service and leisure economy.

Like the 90’s, it would not last.
