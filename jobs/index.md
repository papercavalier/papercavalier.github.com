We are in the [hybrid business][1] of reinventing shopping online.

In 2008, we built [Near Fine][2], a book-dealing algorithm that trades on Amazon. It buys and sells fluidly across countries, from the US to Europe to Japan. It has weathered the subprime slump and the death of print, doubling revenue yearly.

Currently, we are turning our existing business model inside-out to build a product search site that doesn’t suck. Our algorithm is the first customer.

Our dream is to build the future platform — more Etsy, less Amazon — for selling collectible books and other printed matter. Our growing inventory will be its first customer.
 
We currently have over 20 employees who work from offices in New York City and London, and remotely from Tokyo and Buenos Aires.

You are an experienced Ruby and JavaScript developer. You know how to build and maintain bullet-proof applications. You love working with data. Hacking and hewing uncooperative APIs is second nature to you. You find elegant solutions to problems that never have occurred to some engineers in Seattle.

You are an open source advocate.
